        description: "Understanding the methods of how the human mind experiences time passing is at the forefront of psychology and neuroscience research. Dr. Warrick Roseboom and his colleagues at Time Storm have a working AI model, Time Without Clocks, that can accurately predict subjective time from video stimuli. The goal of this project is to make a web-based tool for researchers to utilize the Time Storm model in a user-friendly and efficient manner. To achieve this, I was tasked with creating a modern front-end web application that can interact with the model, a scalable back-end that stores userâ€™s videos, information, and hosts the AI model, and finally, updating and fine-tuning the AI model to be more modern and efficient.",

Users can register, send, receive, and request money from other users, and change their currency with a stand-alone RESTful API service. Digital Wallet has a real-time notification system that notifies the user when a transaction has been made. Super users have access to an admin panel that displays every user on the site as well as their balances and transactions. The admin panel can also create new super users, promote normal users to admin, and revoke their access. Digital Wallet was created using the Django framework following best practices with the Model-View-Template paradigm.",
